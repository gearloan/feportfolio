        %p.caption Our challenge to solve was a much overdue redesign and rebrand on a network of over 300 active communities and do so in a way that could be templatized without losing individuality. I lead the design on this one year project with a team of five designers.

        %p.caption The process of simultaneously rebranding 300 community designed and loved logos, was a tall order. We hired and managed a talented sports logo designer out of the UK to tackle the monumental task. It was a lot, but he got it done and the branding system as a whole was a great success.
